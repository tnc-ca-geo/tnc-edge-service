# Files

- `*scratchpad*`

Scratchpad files contain various snippets of code that have been saved in one place. They are grouped by their applicable context. Scratchpad files are not meant to run top-to-bottom. The expectation is for developers to copy a few lines of code from a scratchpad and paste them into a running environment.

- `vector_data_as_cloudwatch_experiment.py`

This file is the "try-it-and-see" test to prove if AWS's Cloudwatch Metrics product is a good fit for vectors. The results were successful, but not compelling enuogh to create a full feature.

- `data/*`

contains various data sets that were useful during this project. These data set files are not directly referenced anywhere in python code, but may be referenced in notebooks for data analysis.
